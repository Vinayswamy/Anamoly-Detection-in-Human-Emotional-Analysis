# Anamoly-Detection-in-Human-Emotional-Analysis
Anomaly detection in human emotion analysis involves identifying unusual or unexpected patterns in emotional data. This approach aims to detect outliers or anomalies that deviate significantly from the norm in emotional expressions. By using statistical techniques or machine learning algorithms, anomalies in human emotion data can be flagged for further investigation. This method can help in understanding rare emotional states, detecting fraudulent behavior, or uncovering hidden patterns in emotional responses.

The problem it solves: anomaly detection system for analyzing human emotions. Utilize machine learning algorithms to detect irregular patterns in vocal tones, supporting emotion-aware technologies and mental health monitoring.This system can provide valuable insights into individuals' emotional states, helping to identify potential mental health issues or emotional distress. By analyzing vocal tones and patterns, it can detect subtle changes that may indicate underlying emotional fluctuations. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we understand and address mental health concerns, offering a proactive approach to emotional well-being.
Challenges encountered: We encountered various difficulties such as uploading the extensive RAVDESS dataset, which consists of over 20 actors' voices portraying different emotions, available for download on Kaggle.
